## üìÇ Project Structure

* üìì **Notebooks** ‚Äì Colab `.ipynb` files for data analysis, model training, and evaluation:

  * `ApplesProjectEDA.ipynb` ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis and preprocessing.
  * `ApplesProjectModels.ipynb` ‚Äì Model training and evaluation.
* üìà **Results** ‚Äì Performance comparisons and visualizations.
* üìÅ **Data** ‚Äì Dataset files (not included in the repository, see details below).

## üìå Features

* ‚úÖ Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
* ‚úÖ Data distribution tests (Histogram, Q-Q Plot, Shapiro-Wilk, Pearson).
* ‚úÖ Models: XGBoost, LSTM, Random Forest.
* ‚úÖ Evaluation using RMSE vs. STD.

## üìà Results Summary

| Model          | Test STD | RMSE  | Zone / Approach                |
| -------------- | -------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |
| XGBoost        | 2.497    | 2.244 | Individual zone ‚Äì Yonatan      |
| XGBoost + Econ | 2.071    | 1.364 | Combined zones + economic data |
| LSTM           | 2.497    | 2.316 | Individual zone ‚Äì Yonatan      |
| Random Forest  | 2.532    | 2.271 | Combined zones + economic data |

* **XGBoost with combined features** outperformed other models.
* **RMSE significantly lower than STD** indicates high prediction accuracy.
* **LSTM and Random Forest** underperformed in this specific scenario.

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dangutman98/Apple-Yield-Climate-Research.git
cd Apple-Yield-Climate-Research
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Notebooks in Google Colab

* Open `ApplesProjectEDA.ipynb` and run it step-by-step for EDA & preprocessing.
* Then run `ApplesProjectModels.ipynb` for model training and evaluation.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:**
> The datasets are **loaded directly from the authors' Google Drive** during notebook execution.
> You **do not need to upload any files manually**. Simply run the notebook cells as-is.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Recommended Run Order

1. Run `ApplesProjectEDA.ipynb` (mandatory for data preparation).
2. Run `ApplesProjectModels.ipynb` (after EDA is completed).
